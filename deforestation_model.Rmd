    - Set up in panel dataset:
        - Y = outcome (annual rate of deforestation)
        - ~ever treated variable (but thatâ€™s all we have so ignore)
        - Dependent y~ treated_{year=I} + (unit-fixed effects) Community Forest ID + year ID
        - lm(annual_forest_loss ~ treatment + as.factor(community) + as.factor(year))
